# `conda.toml` specification

This page is the normative reference for the `conda.toml` workspace
manifest format read by conda-workspaces.  It is the human-readable
companion to [`schema/conda-toml-1.schema.json`][schema] and the source
material for the future [Conda Enhancement Proposal][ceps] that will
standardise the format across the conda ecosystem.

For tutorials and examples see [Configuration](../configuration.md) and
[Quickstart](../quickstart.md); for plugin name aliases see [Plugin
format names and aliases](format-aliases.md).

## Scope

`conda.toml` describes a *workspace*: a project root that may declare
one or more conda environments composed from reusable *features*, plus
a set of *tasks* that run inside those environments.  It is the
conda-native sibling of `pixi.toml`; the schema is a constrained
subset of `pixi.toml` plus one conda-specific extension, with the
explicit goal that the conda-vouched-for subset can also be consumed
by pixi.  The reverse direction (pixi.toml → conda.toml) holds only
when the `pixi.toml` keeps to the fields described here; see *Pixi
compatibility ladder* below for the precise asymmetry.

Out of scope: package build recipes (use `recipe.yaml`), package
distribution metadata (`pyproject.toml` `[project]`), and lockfile
contents (use the companion `conda.lock`, see *Lockfile relationship*
below).

## File detection

A conda-workspaces tool MUST detect a workspace using one of these two
forms, in order:

1. A file named **`conda.toml`** at the workspace root that contains a
   top-level `[workspace]` table.
2. A file named **`pyproject.toml`** at the workspace root that
   contains a `[tool.conda.workspace]` table.

A `conda.toml` without a `[workspace]` table is permitted: it is
treated as a *tasks-only* manifest (see `[tasks]` below) and does not
constitute a workspace on its own.

For compatibility, conda-workspaces also reads `pixi.toml` (top-level
`[workspace]` / `[project]`) and `pyproject.toml`
`[tool.pixi.workspace]`.  That compatibility surface is not part of
this specification — it is documented in
[Configuration](../configuration.md).

### Search order

Tools that search a directory tree for the manifest MUST consult these
filenames in this order, returning the first hit:

1. `conda.toml`
2. `pixi.toml`
3. `pyproject.toml`

When more than one form is present in the same directory, `conda.toml`
wins.  When `pyproject.toml` contains both `[tool.conda]` and
`[tool.pixi]` tables, `[tool.conda]` wins (see
[Configuration](../configuration.md)).

## Top-level tables

All tables are optional unless marked **required**.  Field types follow
TOML conventions: *string*, *integer*, *boolean*, *array*, *table*,
*inline-table*.

### `[workspace]` (required when used as a workspace manifest)

Workspace metadata.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | no | Workspace name.  Defaults to the workspace directory name. |
| `version` | string | no | Workspace version. |
| `description` | string | no | Short prose description. |
| `channels` | array of *channel* | **yes** | Conda channels in priority order. |
| `platforms` | array of *platform* | **yes** | Platforms the workspace targets.  Used to drive multi-platform solves. |
| `channel-priority` | string | no | One of `"strict"`, `"flexible"`, `"disabled"`.  Maps to conda's solver setting. |
| `envs-dir` | string | no | Where per-env prefixes live, relative to the workspace root.  Default: `.conda/envs`. |

A *channel* is either:

- a string containing a channel name (`"conda-forge"`) or URL
  (`"https://my.channel/label/dev"`), or
- an inline table `{ channel = "<name-or-url>" }`.  Other keys (e.g.
  `priority`) are reserved and currently ignored by this version.

A *platform* is a conda subdir string from the closed enum defined in
the [JSON schema][schema] under `$defs.platform` (e.g. `linux-64`,
`osx-arm64`, `win-64`, `noarch`).

### `[dependencies]`

Conda packages that belong to the *default feature*.  Keys are package
names; values are either a version constraint string or a *detailed
dependency spec*.

```toml
[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24,<2"
scipy = "*"
cuda-toolkit = { version = ">=12", build = "*cuda*" }
```

A detailed conda dependency accepts:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | string | Version constraint (e.g. `">=12"`). |
| `build` | string | Build-string glob (e.g. `"*cuda*"`). |

### `[pypi-dependencies]`

PyPI packages that belong to the default feature.  Keys are package
names; values are either a PEP 508 version-constraint string or a
*detailed PyPI dependency spec*:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | string | PEP 508 constraint. |
| `path` | string | Local path to the package. |
| `editable` | boolean | Install in editable mode. |
| `git` | string | Git repository URL. |
| `branch` | string | Branch (with `git`). |
| `tag` | string | Tag (with `git`). |
| `rev` | string | Revision (with `git`). |

### `[activation]`

Default-feature activation settings.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts` | array of string | Shell scripts sourced on environment activation. |
| `env` | table of `string -> string` | Environment variables set on activation. |

### `[system-requirements]`

Default-feature system-level constraints (e.g. minimum glibc, macOS
version).  All keys are strings; values are stringified version
constraints.  Recognised keys mirror conda's virtual-package names
(`__glibc`, `__osx`, `__cuda`, …).

### `[target.<platform>]`

Per-platform overrides for the default feature.  `<platform>` MUST be
one of the *platform* values listed above.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dependencies` | conda deps | Platform-specific conda overrides. |
| `pypi-dependencies` | PyPI deps | Platform-specific PyPI overrides. |

### `[feature.<name>]`

A reusable group of dependencies and settings.  `<name>` is an
arbitrary identifier referenced from `[environments]`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dependencies` | conda deps | Conda dependencies for this feature. |
| `pypi-dependencies` | PyPI deps | PyPI dependencies for this feature. |
| `channels` | array of *channel* | Additional channels. |
| `platforms` | array of *platform* | Restrict the feature to these platforms. |
| `system-requirements` | table | Per-feature system requirements. |
| `activation` | table | Per-feature activation. |
| `target` | table of `[target.<platform>]` | Per-platform dep overrides for the feature. |
| `tasks` | table | Tasks contributed by this feature; merged into the workspace task set. |

### `[environments]`

A named environment is a composition of one or more features plus
(by default) the *default feature* defined by the top-level
`[dependencies]`, `[pypi-dependencies]`, `[activation]` and
`[system-requirements]` tables.

Two forms are accepted:

```toml
[environments]
test = ["test"]                                     # shorthand
docs = { features = ["docs"], no-default-feature = false }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `features` | array of string | Feature names to include in addition to the default feature. |
| `solve-group` | string | Solve-group identifier; environments in the same solve-group are version-coordinated. |
| `no-default-feature` | boolean | If `true`, exclude the default feature from this environment.  Default: `false`. |

When `[environments]` is omitted entirely, a single implicit
environment named `default` is used, composed from the default feature
only.

### `[tasks]`

Named tasks runnable via `conda task run <name>`.  Each value is
either a command string or a *task table*.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd` | string or array of string | Command to execute.  Omit to define an alias whose only purpose is `depends-on`. |
| `args` | array of *task arg* | Named arguments with optional defaults. |
| `depends-on` | array of *task dep* | Tasks to run before this one. |
| `cwd` | string | Working directory for the task. |
| `env` | table of `string -> string` | Environment variables to set. |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description. |
| `inputs` | array of string | Glob patterns for cache inputs. |
| `outputs` | array of string | Glob patterns for cache outputs. |
| `clean-env` | boolean | Run with a minimal environment. |
| `default-environment` | string | Conda environment to activate by default for this task. |
| `target` | table of `[target.<platform>.tasks]` | Per-platform overrides. |

A *task arg* is an inline table such as
`{ arg = "path", default = "tests/" }`.

A *task dep* is one of:

- a string naming another task: `"build"`, or
- an inline table with extra fields:
  `{ task = "test", args = ["tests/unit/"], environment = "py311" }`.

### `[target.<platform>.tasks]`

Platform-specific task overrides.  Each entry follows the same shape
as a `[tasks]` entry.

## Composition rules

When a tool resolves an environment named `<env>`:

1. Start with the default feature (top-level `[dependencies]`,
   `[pypi-dependencies]`, `[activation]`, `[system-requirements]`,
   `[target]`) unless the environment sets `no-default-feature = true`.
2. Merge in each named feature listed in `features`, in order.  Later
   features override earlier ones for conflicting keys; lists are
   concatenated and de-duplicated.
3. Apply `[target.<platform>]` overrides for the host's platform last.

Channel order is preserved.  Duplicate dependency names within the
same stack (conda or PyPI) are an error and the tool MUST surface them
to the user.

## Lockfile relationship

`conda workspace lock` and `conda workspace install` produce and
consume **`conda.lock`** at the workspace root.  The lockfile schema is
[rattler-lock v6][rattler-lock] (the same schema `pixi.lock` uses) with
one on-disk difference: `conda.lock` writes `version: 1` instead of
`version: 6` so tools can identify the file as conda-workspaces-owned
at a glance.  The remainder of the document — `environments`,
`packages`, channels, platform package lists — is byte-compatible.

See [Plugin format names and aliases](format-aliases.md) for the
canonical and alias strings under which `conda.lock` is registered.

[rattler-lock]: https://github.com/conda/rattler/tree/main/crates/rattler_lock

## Embedded form (`pyproject.toml`)

The same tables are accepted under `[tool.conda.<name>]` inside a
`pyproject.toml`:

| Top-level table | Embedded equivalent |
|---|---|
| `[workspace]` | `[tool.conda.workspace]` |
| `[dependencies]` | `[tool.conda.dependencies]` |
| `[pypi-dependencies]` | `[tool.conda.pypi-dependencies]` |
| `[activation]` | `[tool.conda.activation]` |
| `[system-requirements]` | `[tool.conda.system-requirements]` |
| `[target.<platform>]` | `[tool.conda.target.<platform>]` |
| `[feature.<name>]` | `[tool.conda.feature.<name>]` |
| `[environments]` | `[tool.conda.environments]` |
| `[tasks]` | `[tool.conda.tasks]` |

When both `conda.toml` and `pyproject.toml` exist in the same
directory, `conda.toml` wins.  When a `pyproject.toml` contains both
`[tool.conda]` and `[tool.pixi]` tables, `[tool.conda]` wins.

## Pixi compatibility ladder

`conda.toml` and `pixi.toml` share a deliberately overlapping table
layout, but they are not byte-for-byte interchangeable.  The
relationship is:

| Direction | Holds? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Every valid `conda.toml` is a valid `pixi.toml` (modulo filename). | **Yes** | The fields enumerated in this spec are all accepted by pixi. |
| Every valid `pixi.toml` is a valid `conda.toml`. | **No** | Pixi's `[workspace]` accepts additional fields (`authors`, `license`, `readme`, `homepage`, `repository`, `documentation`, `requires-pixi`, `preview`, `build-variants`, `conda-pypi-map`, …) that this v1 schema does not list.  The schema rejects unknown keys (`additionalProperties: false`); pixi-only fields are therefore not accepted in a `conda.toml`. |
| pixi reads our `default-environment` task field. | **No** | `default-environment` (in `[tasks]` and `[feature.*.tasks]`) is the only conda-workspaces extension; pixi will silently ignore it. |
| conda-workspaces reads `pixi.toml`. | **Yes** | conda-workspaces ships a separate compatibility reader for `pixi.toml` and `[tool.pixi.*]`; that reader is *out of scope* for this spec and is documented in [Configuration](../configuration.md). |

Two intentional differences from `pixi.toml`:

- `conda.toml` accepts only `[workspace]`; the legacy pixi `[project]`
  table is not part of this specification.
- conda-workspaces resolves dependencies with conda's solver
  (libmamba) and installs them as conventional conda prefixes; pixi's
  build-process options (e.g. `[package]`-style build recipes) are not
  part of this specification.

If you need pixi-only fields, write a `pixi.toml` and let
conda-workspaces' compatibility reader handle it; do not extend
`conda.toml` with them.

## Versioning policy

The schema is versioned with a single integer (`1`).  A future
backwards-incompatible change to required fields, semantics, or
defaults bumps the version to `2` and gets a sibling schema URL
(`https://schemas.conda.org/conda-toml-2.schema.json`) and plugin
canonical name (`conda-workspaces-v2`).  Aliases follow the rules in
[`format-aliases.md`](format-aliases.md).

Backwards-compatible additions (new optional fields, new platforms in
the *platform* enum) do *not* bump the version.  Tools MUST ignore
unknown top-level keys and unknown keys inside known tables in the
same major version.

## Open questions (non-normative)

These are tracked for the CEP draft and are not part of `v1`:

- Whether `[workspace]` should be required to carry `version` and
  `name` (currently both optional).
- Whether `solve-group` semantics need a normative description beyond
  "version-coordinated".
- Whether to standardise an `[envs]` shorthand that maps a feature
  one-to-one to an environment of the same name.
- Discovery rules for nested workspaces (currently parent-directory
  search stops at the first match).
- Whether `[tool.pixi.*]` compatibility belongs in this specification
  or in a separate "compatibility" CEP.
- Whether `conda.toml` should exist as a separate filename at all, or
  whether the spec should describe a "conda-workspaces dialect of
  `pixi.toml`" — i.e. a `pixi.toml` plus the single
  `default-environment` extension, without a parallel filename or
  schema URL.  Trade-off: governance ownership (conda community vs.
  Prefix.dev) versus format proliferation.  See the CEP tracker for
  discussion.
