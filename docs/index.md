# conda-workspaces

Project-scoped multi-environment workspace management for conda, with pixi
manifest compatibility.

Define your environments, features, and dependencies in a single manifest.
conda-workspaces reads `conda.toml`, `pixi.toml`, or `pyproject.toml` and
delegates solving and installation to conda — no extra solver, no new
package manager, just workspaces on top of the tools you already use.

## Install

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-workspaces
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pixi

```bash
pixi global install conda-workspaces
```

## Define a workspace

Create a `conda.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[workspace]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24"

[feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"

[environments]
default = { solve-group = "default" }
test = { features = ["test"], solve-group = "default" }
```

Then install and use your environments:

```bash
cw install                    # solve + install + generate conda.lock
cw run -e test -- pytest -v   # run a command in an environment
cw shell test                 # spawn a shell with test env activated
cw install --locked           # reproducible install from conda.lock
cw list                       # show defined environments
```

Environments are standard conda prefixes stored in `.conda/envs/` inside
your project directory. They work with `conda activate` and all existing
conda tooling.

## Why conda-workspaces?

[pixi](https://pixi.sh) introduced an excellent workspace model for
managing multi-environment projects, but it brings its own solver and
installation machinery. conda-workspaces reuses that same manifest format
while delegating all solving and installation to conda's existing
infrastructure.

This means:

- Workspaces read from `pixi.toml`, `conda.toml`, or `pyproject.toml` —
  one manifest, multiple tools
- Environments are solved by conda / libmamba and installed as regular
  conda prefixes
- Lock files (`conda.lock`) capture exact package URLs for reproducible
  installs without re-solving
- Composable features, solve-groups, platform overrides, and PyPI
  dependencies all work out of the box
- Ships as a conda plugin (`conda workspace`) and a standalone `cw` CLI
