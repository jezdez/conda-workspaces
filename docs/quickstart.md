# Quick start

## Installation

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-workspaces
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pixi

```bash
pixi global install conda-workspaces
```

:::

::::

Both methods provide the `cw` and `ct` shortcut commands.
Installing into a conda base environment also registers the
`conda workspace` and `conda task` plugin subcommands.

## Your first tasks

![task quickstart demo](../demos/task-quickstart.gif)

Create a `conda.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[tasks]
hello = "echo 'Hello from conda-workspaces!'"
test = { cmd = "pytest tests/ -v", depends-on = ["build"] }
build = "python -m build"
```

Run a task:

```bash
conda task run hello
conda task run test    # runs build first, then test
conda task list        # see all tasks
```

Tasks run in your current conda environment. No workspace definition is
required — you can start with tasks alone and add workspace features later.

## Your first workspace

![quickstart demo](../demos/quickstart.gif)

Add workspace configuration to the same `conda.toml`:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} conda.toml

```toml
[workspace]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24"

[feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[environments]
default = []
test = { features = ["test"] }
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pixi.toml

```toml
[workspace]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24"

[feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[environments]
default = []
test = { features = ["test"] }
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pyproject.toml

```toml
[tool.conda.workspace]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

[tool.conda.dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24"

[tool.conda.feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[tool.conda.environments]
default = []
test = { features = ["test"] }
```

:::

::::

:::{tip}
`cw` and `ct` are available as shorter aliases for `conda workspace`
and `conda task`.
:::

Or use the init command to scaffold one:

```bash
conda workspace init
# or: conda workspace init --format conda
# or: conda workspace init --format pyproject
```

## Install environments

```bash
conda workspace install
```

This creates project-local conda environments under `.conda/envs/` for
each environment defined in your manifest. A `conda.lock` file is
generated automatically after solving.

You can point to a specific manifest with `--file` / `-f`:

```bash
conda workspace install -f path/to/conda.toml
```

To recreate environments from scratch, use `--force-reinstall`:

```bash
conda workspace install --force-reinstall
```

## Lock

![lockfile demo](../demos/lockfile.gif)

The `conda workspace lock` command runs the solver and records the solution in
`conda.lock` without installing any environments:

```bash
conda workspace lock
```

## Reproducible installs

Use `--locked` to install from the lockfile. This validates that the
lockfile is still fresh relative to the manifest — if the manifest has
changed, the install fails:

```bash
conda workspace install --locked
```

Use `--frozen` to install from the lockfile as-is, without checking
freshness:

```bash
conda workspace install --frozen
```

## Run in workspace environments

Once your workspace is installed, run tasks in specific environments:

```bash
conda task run -e test pytest -v
```

Run a one-shot command in an environment:

```bash
conda workspace run -e test -- python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

Or spawn an interactive shell:

```bash
conda workspace shell -e test
```

## Add dependencies

```bash
conda workspace add numpy
```

Add to a specific feature:

```bash
conda workspace add --feature test pytest
```

Add a PyPI dependency:

```bash
conda workspace add --pypi requests
```

## List packages and environments

```bash
conda workspace list              # packages in default env
conda workspace list -e test      # packages in test env
conda workspace envs              # list defined environments
```

## Workspace overview

```bash
conda workspace info
conda workspace info -e test      # details for a specific environment
```
