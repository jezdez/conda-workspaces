# Features

## Tasks

### Task commands

![task quickstart demo](../demos/task-quickstart.gif)

A task's `cmd` can be a simple string or a list of strings joined with
spaces:

```toml
[tasks]
build = "python -m build"
build-alt = { cmd = ["python", "-m", "build", "--wheel"] }
```

### Task dependencies

![depends-on demo](../demos/depends-on.gif)

Tasks can depend on other tasks. Dependencies are resolved with
topological ordering so everything runs in the right sequence:

```toml
[tasks]
compile = { cmd = "gcc -o main main.c", description = "Compile the program" }
test = { cmd = "./main --test", depends-on = ["compile"], description = "Run tests" }

[tasks.check]
depends-on = ["test", "lint"]
description = "Run all checks"
```

Running `conda task run check` resolves the full dependency graph and
runs each task in order.

### Task aliases

Tasks with no `cmd` that only list dependencies act as aliases:

```toml
[tasks.check]
depends-on = ["test", "lint", "typecheck"]
description = "Run all checks"
```

### Hidden tasks

Tasks prefixed with `_` are hidden from `conda task list` but can still
be referenced as dependencies or run explicitly:

```toml
[tasks]
_setup = "mkdir -p build/"

[tasks.build]
cmd = "make"
depends-on = ["_setup"]
```

### Task arguments

![templates demo](../demos/templates.gif)

Tasks can accept named arguments with optional defaults:

```toml
[tasks.test]
cmd = "pytest {{ test_path }} -v"
args = [
  { arg = "test_path", default = "tests/" },
]
description = "Run tests on a path"
```

Run with:

```bash
conda task run test src/tests/
```

### Template variables

Commands support Jinja2 templates with `conda.*` context variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{ conda.platform }}` | Current platform (e.g. `osx-arm64`) |
| `{{ conda.environment_name }}` | Name of the active conda environment |
| `{{ conda.environment.name }}` | Active environment name |
| `{{ conda.prefix }}` | Target conda environment prefix path |
| `{{ conda.version }}` | conda version |
| `{{ conda.manifest_path }}` | Path to the task file |
| `{{ conda.init_cwd }}` | Current working directory at rendering time |
| `{{ conda.is_win }}` | `True` on Windows |
| `{{ conda.is_unix }}` | `True` on non-Windows |
| `{{ conda.is_linux }}` | `True` on Linux |
| `{{ conda.is_osx }}` | `True` on macOS |

When reading from `pixi.toml`, `{{ pixi.platform }}` etc. also work as
aliases.

### Task environment variables

```toml
[tasks.test]
cmd = "pytest"
env = { PYTHONPATH = "src", DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///test.db" }
```

### Clean environment

Run a task with only essential environment variables:

```toml
[tasks]
isolated-test = { cmd = "pytest", clean-env = true }
```

Or via CLI: `conda task run test --clean-env`

### Task caching

![caching demo](../demos/caching.gif)

When `inputs` and `outputs` are specified, tasks are cached and
re-execution is skipped when inputs haven't changed:

```toml
[tasks.build]
cmd = "python -m build"
inputs = ["src/**/*.py", "pyproject.toml"]
outputs = ["dist/*.whl"]
```

:::{tip}
The cache uses a fast `(mtime, size)` pre-check before falling back to
SHA-256 hashing, so the overhead on cache hits is minimal.
:::

### Platform-specific tasks

![platform overrides demo](../demos/platform-overrides.gif)

Override task fields per platform using the `target` key:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} TOML

```toml
[tasks]
clean = "rm -rf build/"

[target.win-64.tasks]
clean = "rd /s /q build"
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Jinja2 conditional

```toml
[tasks]
clean = "{% if conda.is_win %}rd /s /q build{% else %}rm -rf build/{% endif %}"
```

:::

::::

### Task environment targeting

Tasks run in your current conda environment by default. When used with
a workspace, you can target a specific environment:

```bash
conda task run test -e myenv
```

Tasks can also declare a default environment:

```toml
[tasks.test-legacy]
cmd = "pytest"
default-environment = "py38-compat"
```

---

## Environments

![multi-env demo](../demos/multi-env.gif)

Environments are named conda prefixes composed from one or more features.
Each environment is installed under `.conda/envs/<name>/` in your project.

```toml
[environments]
default = []
test = { features = ["test"] }
docs = { features = ["docs"] }
```

The `default` environment always exists and includes the top-level
`[dependencies]`. Named environments inherit the default feature unless
`no-default-feature = true` is set.

:::{note}
Pixi's `solve-group` key is accepted in manifests for compatibility but
has no effect. Conda's solver operates on a single environment at a time
and does not support cross-environment version coordination. Each
environment is solved independently.
:::

## Features

Features are composable groups of dependencies, channels, and settings.
They map to `[feature.<name>]` tables in the manifest:

```toml
[feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[feature.docs.dependencies]
sphinx = ">=7.0"
myst-parser = ">=3.0"
```

When an environment includes multiple features, dependencies are merged
in order. Later features override earlier ones for the same package name.

## Channels

Channels are specified at the workspace level and can be overridden per
feature:

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]

[feature.special.dependencies]
some-pkg = "*"

[feature.special]
channels = ["conda-forge", "bioconda"]
```

Feature channels are appended after workspace channels, with duplicates
removed.

## Platform targeting

![multi-platform demo](../demos/multi-platform.gif)

Per-platform dependency overrides use `[target.<platform>]` tables:

```toml
[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"

[target.linux-64.dependencies]
linux-headers = ">=5.10"

[target.osx-arm64.dependencies]
llvm-openmp = ">=14.0"
```

Platform overrides are merged on top of the base dependencies when
resolving for a specific platform.

### Known vs. declared platforms

The workspace-level `platforms` list is the default set every
environment can be solved for. Individual features may declare
additional platforms, and those are reachable through any
environment that activates that feature. To see the full reachable
set, run:

```bash
conda workspace info            # text view, extra "Known Platforms" row
conda workspace info --json     # JSON "known_platforms" key
```

`conda workspace lock --platform <subdir>` validates against this
reachable set, so typos like `lixux-64` are rejected before the
solver runs.

## PyPI dependencies

PyPI dependencies are specified separately from conda dependencies:

```toml
[pypi-dependencies]
my-local-pkg = { path = ".", editable = true }
some-pypi-only = ">=1.0"

[feature.test.pypi-dependencies]
pytest-benchmark = ">=4.0"
```

PyPI package names are translated to their conda equivalents (via the
[grayskull mapping](https://github.com/conda/grayskull)) and merged
into the same solver call as conda dependencies. This means the solver
(via the conda-rattler-solver backend) resolves conda and PyPI packages
together in a single pass, and `conda-pypi`'s wheel extractor handles
`.whl` installation.

To use PyPI dependencies you need:

- [conda-pypi](https://github.com/conda/conda-pypi) for name mapping
  and wheel extraction
- [conda-rattler-solver](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-rattler-solver)
  as the solver backend
- A channel that indexes PyPI wheels (e.g. the
  [conda-pypi-test](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-pypi-test)
  channel for development)

Editable, git, and URL dependencies (e.g. `path = "."`, `git = "..."`)
are handled separately via `conda-pypi`'s build system after the main
solve completes. If `conda-pypi` is not installed, PyPI dependencies
are skipped with a warning.

## No-default-feature

An environment can opt out of inheriting the default feature:

```toml
[environments]
minimal = { features = ["minimal"], no-default-feature = true }
```

This is useful for environments that need a completely independent
dependency set.

## Activation

Features can specify activation scripts and environment variables:

```toml
[activation]
scripts = ["scripts/activate.sh"]
env = { MY_VAR = "value" }

[feature.dev.activation]
env = { DEBUG = "1" }
```

Activation settings are merged across features when composing an
environment. After `conda workspace install`, environment variables are written to
the prefix state file (available via `conda activate`) and activation
scripts are copied to `$PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/`.

## System requirements

System requirements declare minimum system-level dependencies:

```toml
[system-requirements]
cuda = "12"
glibc = "2.17"
```

System requirements are added as virtual package constraints
(`__cuda >=12`, `__glibc >=2.17`) during environment solving. This
ensures the solver only picks packages compatible with the declared
system capabilities.

## Channel priority

The workspace-level `channel-priority` setting overrides conda's global
channel priority during solving:

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
channel-priority = "strict"
```

Valid values are `strict`, `flexible`, and `disabled`. When not set,
conda's default channel priority applies.

## Lock

conda-workspaces generates a `conda.lock` file in YAML format based on
the rattler-lock v6 specification. The `conda workspace lock` command runs the solver
and records the solution — it does not require environments to be
installed first.

```bash
# Generate or update the lockfile for every platform declared in the manifest
conda workspace lock

# Lock only a subset of platforms (repeatable flag)
conda workspace lock --platform linux-64 --platform osx-arm64

# Keep going when individual (environment, platform) pairs fail to solve
conda workspace lock --skip-unsolvable

# Install from lockfile, validating freshness against the manifest
conda workspace install --locked

# Install from lockfile as-is without checking freshness
conda workspace install --frozen
```

`conda workspace lock` solves every environment for every platform it
declares in the manifest. Each solve runs with conda's
`context._subdir` pointed at the target platform so virtual packages
(`__linux`, `__osx`, `__win`) match the target, not the host. Pin
tighter constraints with `CONDA_OVERRIDE_*` or the
`[system-requirements]` table when cross-compiling (for example, to
fix a minimum `__glibc` version when solving `linux-64` from macOS).

Solves are fail-fast by default: the first platform that cannot be
resolved raises an error that names the environment and the platform,
and no lockfile is written. Pass `--skip-unsolvable` to keep locking
the remaining pairs, emitting a yellow `Skipping ...` line for each
one that failed. If *every* pair fails, the command still raises
with an aggregated summary rather than writing an empty lockfile —
non-solver errors (missing channel, invalid manifest, etc.) always
abort regardless of the flag.

The lockfile contains all environments and their resolved packages:

```yaml
version: 1
environments:
  default:
    channels:
      - url: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/
    packages:
      linux-64:
        - conda: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/python-3.12.0-...
  test:
    channels:
      - url: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/
    packages:
      linux-64:
        - conda: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/python-3.12.0-...
        - conda: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/pytest-8.0.0-...
packages:
  - conda: https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/python-3.12.0-...
    sha256: abc123...
    depends:
      - libffi >=3.4
    # ...
```

Using `--locked` skips the solver and installs the exact package URLs
recorded in the lockfile. It validates that the lockfile is still fresh
relative to the manifest — if the manifest has changed since the lockfile
was generated, the install fails. Use `--frozen` to skip freshness
checks entirely and install the lockfile as-is.

You can also point to a specific manifest with `--file` / `-f`:

```bash
conda workspace install -f path/to/conda.toml
```

## Project-local environments

All environments are installed under `.conda/envs/` in your project
directory, keeping them isolated from global conda environments:

```
my-project/
├── conda.toml
├── conda.lock
├── .conda/
│   └── envs/
│       ├── default/
│       ├── test/
│       └── docs/
└── src/
```

Environments are standard conda prefixes. Use `conda workspace run -e <name> -- CMD`
to run a command in an environment, `conda workspace shell -e <name>` for an
interactive shell, or `conda activate .conda/envs/<name>` directly.

## CI and Docker

### Optimizing disk usage with hardlinks

conda hardlinks packages from its global cache into environment
prefixes, which saves significant disk space. In CI and Docker the
global cache is often on a different filesystem (or volume) from the
project directory, causing conda to silently fall back to copying
packages — roughly doubling disk usage per environment.

Set the `CONDA_PKGS_DIRS` environment variable to a project-local path
before installing so that the cache and environments share a filesystem:

```bash
export CONDA_PKGS_DIRS="$PWD/.conda/pkgs"
conda workspace install
```

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Install workspace
  run: |
    export CONDA_PKGS_DIRS="$PWD/.conda/pkgs"
    conda workspace install
```

:::

:::{tab-item} GitLab CI

```yaml
install:
  script:
    - export CONDA_PKGS_DIRS="$PWD/.conda/pkgs"
    - conda workspace install
```

:::

::::

On developer workstations the global cache is usually on the same
filesystem and hardlinks work without any extra configuration.
