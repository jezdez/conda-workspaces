"""Data models for workspace configuration.

These dataclasses represent the parsed workspace manifest in a
format-agnostic way.  Parsers convert from pixi.toml / pyproject.toml /
conda.toml into these models; downstream code only works with
these types.

Conda dependencies use :class:`~conda.models.match_spec.MatchSpec`
directly, and channels use :class:`~conda.models.channel.Channel`,
so the workspace layer benefits from conda's own validation, URL
resolution, and spec parsing.
