        Mirrors ``rattler_virtual_packages::VirtualPackages::detect_for_platform``
        from ``rattler``: when we solve for a target that the *host* cannot
        detect a virtual package for (e.g. ``linux-64`` from macOS emits
        no ``__glibc`` record), inject conservative defaults so packages
        gated on those virtuals remain resolvable out of the box.

        Precedence (highest to lowest):

        1. ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_*`` already present in :data:`os.environ` — the
           user is explicitly in charge and this helper returns no entry
           for that key, leaving the existing value untouched.
        2. ``[system-requirements]`` declared in the manifest for the same
           virtual package (e.g. ``glibc = "2.28"``) — used as the override
           so the virtual package record lines up with the spec constraint
           :mod:`conda_workspaces.envs._apply_system_requirements` appends.
        3. A conservative built-in baseline (``__glibc == 2.17`` for any
           non-native linux target, ``__osx >= 10.15`` / ``>= 11.0`` for
           ``osx-64`` / ``osx-arm64`` cross-compiles, presence-only
           ``__win`` for win targets).

        ``__cuda`` and ``__archspec`` are *not* seeded — the caller must
        opt in via ``[system-requirements]`` or ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_*`` if
        they want those available.  Native solves (target family matches
        host family) return an empty mapping so byte-for-byte output stays

        Uses conda's solver API to resolve dependencies without
        installing, producing the list of exact packages that would be
        installed.  Applies the same transformations as
        :func:`conda_workspaces.envs.install_environment`: PyPI deps
        are translated and merged, system requirements are added as
        virtual package constraints, and channel priority is honoured.

        The solver is targeted at *platform* by (a) constructing it
        with ``subdirs=(platform, "noarch")`` and (b) overriding
        ``context._subdir`` for the duration of the solve.  Conda's
        virtual package plugins (``__linux``, ``__osx``, ``__win``)
        gate on ``context.subdir``, so this single override also
        yields the correct cross-platform virtual package set.

        On cross-compiled targets the host cannot detect
        libc/kernel/macOS versions, so
        :meth:`scoped_virtual_packages` seeds conservative
        ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_*`` defaults for the duration of the solve.
        User knobs stay authoritative: explicit ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_*``
        env vars are left untouched, and ``[system-requirements]``
        versions are lifted into the override so ``__glibc >=2.28``
        in the manifest and the baseline record agree.

        *prefix* is the environment prefix path the solver should
        target — workspace-owned, so callers that run under a
        :class:`~conda_workspaces.context.WorkspaceContext` pass
        ``ctx.env_prefix(resolved.name)``.

        Raises :class:`~conda_workspaces.exceptions.SolveError` when
