"""Lockfile generation, consumption and env-spec plugin for ``conda.lock``.

Single source of truth for every ``conda.lock`` concern.  The file owns
the read path, the write path, the ``CondaEnvironmentSpecifier`` plugin
class (:class:`CondaLockLoader`), and the plugin metadata (name,
aliases, default filename) consumed by ``plugin.py`` and
``env_export.py``.

The ``conda.lock`` format is a *derivative* of rattler-lock v6
(``pixi.lock``): same schema machinery, same top-level keys
(``version``, ``environments``, ``packages``), but with an on-disk
``version: 1`` byte that identifies the file as conda-workspaces-owned.
:class:`CondaLockLoader` shares rattler-lock v6 conversion logic with
:mod:`conda_lockfiles.rattler_lock.v6` via an in-memory ``version: 6``
swap, so we do not re-implement YAML -> ``Environment`` conversion.

The file layout is::

    version: 1
    environments:
      <name>:
        channels: [{url: ...}, ...]
        packages:
          <platform>: [{conda: <url>}, ...]
    packages:
      - conda: <url>
        sha256: ...
        md5: ...
        depends: [...]
        ...

On the *write* side, :func:`generate_lockfile` solves each environment
and delegates YAML serialisation to the ``multiplatform_export`` hook
in :mod:`.env_export` (the same path ``conda export`` uses), so every
``conda.lock`` on disk comes out of a single formatter.  On the *read*
side, :func:`install_from_lockfile` extracts the package list for one
environment + platform via :class:`CondaLockLoader` and installs the
exact URLs, bypassing the solver entirely.
