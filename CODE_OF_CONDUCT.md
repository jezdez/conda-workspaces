# Conda Organization Code of Conduct

# The Short Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the conda Organization.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

The conda Organization is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

# Conda Organization Diversity Statement

The conda Organization welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and learning, and we work together as a community to help each other live out these values.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger, more vibrant, and produces better software and better science. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors, more sources for ideas, and fewer shared assumptions that might hinder development or research.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific identities that are impacted by systemic discrimination and marginalization. We welcome all people to participate in the conda Organization community regardless of their identity or background.

# Conda Organization Code of Conduct: Introduction & Scope

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the conda Organization community. It should be honored in any conda Organization-related activities, by anyone claiming affiliation with the conda Organization, and especially when someone is representing the conda Organization in any role (including as an event volunteer or speaker).

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the conda Organization, including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, forums, and any other communication channel used by our community. The code of conduct equally applies at conda Organization events and governs standards of behavior for attendees, speakers, volunteers, booth staff, and event sponsors.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our understanding of a collaborative, inclusive community culture. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the conda Organization community.

The conda Organization Code of Conduct follows below.

# Standards for Behavior

The conda Organization is a worldwide community. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

**Please always be kind and courteous. There's never a need to be mean or rude or disrespectful.** Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

We strive to:

**Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.** We remember that the conda Organization is crafted by human beings who deserve to be treated with kindness and empathy. We work together to resolve conflict and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

**Be collaborative.** Our work depends on the participation of many people, and in turn others depend on our work. Open source communities depend on effective and friendly collaboration to achieve their goals.

**Be inquisitive.** Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.

**Be careful in the words that we choose.** We are careful and respectful in our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience.

We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviors, such as:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Excessive profanity (please avoid curse words; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing)
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Violent or intimidating threats or language directed against another person
- Inappropriate physical contact and/or unwelcome sexual attention or sexual comments
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
- Trolling or insulting and derogatory comments
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in a specific group, including level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurotype, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality
- Public or private harassment
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or direct message history, without the sender's consent
- Continuing to initiate interaction (such as photography, recording, messaging, or conversation) with someone after being asked to stop
- Sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications, such as heckling of a speaker
- Publishing (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing"), such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors

The conda Organization prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The conda CoC Committee reserves the right not to act on complaints including, but not limited to:

* 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## Behavior Outside of conda Organization Spaces

The CoC Committee does not influence behavior and membership in spaces outside the conda Organization. However, if you are being harassed by a member of the conda community outside our spaces, you may still report it to the CoC Committee. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by conda community members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.

The CoC Committee reserves the right to exclude people from conda Organization spaces based on their past behavior, including behavior outside conda Organization spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the conda community.

# Confidentiality and Public Statements to the Community

The CoC Committee will keep the identity of the reporter confidential.

Whenever possible, CoC cases will be reported to the community. The level of detail in reports will vary from case to case. Reports will describe at least the type of infraction that was reported, and the Committee's decision and any action taken.  In most cases, the report will not include personally identifiable information.

# Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone. The conda Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee and the conda Organization take reports of misconduct very seriously and are committed to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature of our community.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The conda CoC Committee commits to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## How to Submit a Report

You can report an incident:

* via the [Incident Reporting Form](https://form.jotform.com/221527028480048)
* via email: [conduct@conda.org](mailto:conduct@conda.org)

- Nothing (if no violation occurred)
