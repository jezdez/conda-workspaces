Project-scoped multi-environment workspaces and task runner for conda,
with pixi manifest compatibility.

Define environments and tasks in your project manifest, compose
environments from reusable features, and let conda handle the solving and
installation. Works with existing pixi manifests -- no new package manager
required.

## Quick start

![quickstart demo](demos/quickstart.gif)

Create a `conda.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[workspace]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = ">=1.24"

[feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[environments]
test = { features = ["test"] }

[tasks]
test = { cmd = "pytest tests/ -v", description = "Run the test suite" }
lint = "ruff check ."

[tasks.check]
depends-on = ["test", "lint"]
```

Install and manage your environments, then run tasks:

```console
$ cw install              # solve + install + generate conda.lock
$ cw envs                 # list defined environments
$ conda task run check    # runs lint and test in dependency order
$ cw shell -e test        # spawn a shell with test env activated
$ cw install --locked     # reproducible install from conda.lock
```

## Why?

Conda handles environments and packages. [pixi](https://pixi.sh) introduced
a great project model with multi-environment workspaces and a task runner,
but it brings its own solver and environment management.

conda-workspaces reads pixi-compatible manifests and delegates solving and
installation to conda's own infrastructure. You get workspace management
and task running inside the conda CLI without switching tools.

## What it does

- Reads `conda.toml`, `pixi.toml`, and `pyproject.toml` workspace manifests
- Multi-environment support with composable features
- Project-local environments in `.conda/envs/`
- Lockfile generation (`conda.lock`) in rattler-lock v6 format for reproducible installs
- Per-platform dependency overrides via `[target.<platform>]`
- PyPI dependencies translated and resolved alongside conda packages via conda-pypi
- Activation scripts and environment variables per feature
- System requirements as virtual package constraints
- Per-workspace channel priority override
- Task dependencies with topological ordering (`depends-on`)
- Jinja2 templates in commands (`{{ conda.platform }}`, conditionals)
- Task arguments with defaults, input/output caching, and per-platform overrides
- Standalone `cw` / `ct` CLIs and `conda workspace` / `conda task` plugin subcommands

## Installation

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-workspaces
```

## CLI

conda-workspaces registers as `conda workspace` and `conda task`, and
provides `cw` and `ct` as standalone shortcuts.

### Workspace commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cw init` | Initialize a new workspace manifest |
| `cw install` | Create/update workspace environments |
| `cw install --locked` | Install from lockfile (skip solving) |
| `cw lock` | Generate/update `conda.lock` |
| `cw list` | List packages in an environment |
| `cw envs` | List defined environments |
| `cw info [ENV]` | Show environment details |
| `cw add SPECS...` | Add dependencies |
| `cw remove SPECS...` | Remove dependencies |
| `cw shell [ENV]` | Spawn a shell with an environment activated |
| `cw activate [ENV]` | Print activation instructions |
| `cw clean` | Remove installed environments |

### Task commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `conda task run TASK` | Run a task (with dependency resolution) |
| `conda task list` | List available tasks |
| `conda task add NAME CMD` | Add a task to the manifest |
| `conda task remove NAME` | Remove a task from the manifest |
| `conda task export` | Export tasks to `conda.toml` format |

The `ct` shortcut works like `conda task`: `ct run check`, `ct list`, etc.

## What it doesn't do

conda-workspaces is a workspace manager and task runner, not a package
manager replacement. It does not bundle its own solver or bypass conda's
installation machinery. If you want a fully integrated tool that handles
everything including its own solver, see [pixi](https://pixi.sh).

## Demos

See [demos/README.md](demos/README.md) for animated terminal recordings
of workspace and task features.

## Development

```bash
pixi install
pixi run test
pixi run lint
```

## Acknowledgements

The workspace and task system in conda-workspaces is directly inspired by
the work of the [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev) team on
[pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi). Their design of workspace
manifests, features, environments, platform targeting, task dependencies,
caching, and template variables provided the blueprint for this plugin.
