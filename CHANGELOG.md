## Unreleased

### Added

- `conda workspace quickstart` bootstraps a workspace in one step,
  composing `init`, `add`, `install`, and `shell`. Run it in an empty
  directory to scaffold a manifest, add the specs passed on the
  command line (`conda workspace quickstart python=3.14 numpy`),
  install the environment, and drop into an activated shell.
- `conda workspace quickstart --copy` (alias `--clone`) copies an
  existing workspace's manifest from a directory or file instead of
  running `init`. `--no-shell` skips the final shell step (implied by
  `--json`).
- New manifest-format exporter plugins for `conda workspace export`:
  `conda-toml`, `pixi-toml`, and `pyproject-toml`. Registered via the
  same `conda_environment_exporters` hook as `environment-yaml` and
  `conda-workspaces-lock-v1`, so per-platform projection, `--file`
  inference, and `--output` streaming carry over. Together with
  `conda workspace import`, `conda workspace` now translates in both
  directions across every supported manifest dialect.
- The `pyproject-toml` exporter splices its content under
  `[tool.conda]` and preserves peer tables (`[project]`,
  `[build-system]`, `[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.pixi]`, ...) when the
  target file already exists.
- `conda workspace lock --output <path>` writes the lockfile to an
  arbitrary path (e.g. `conda.lock.linux-64`) so matrix CI runners
  can each emit a per-platform fragment.
- `conda workspace lock --merge <glob>` (repeatable) stitches
  lockfile fragments back into a single `conda.lock` without
  re-solving. Validates schema version and per-environment channel
  agreement, rejects overlapping `(environment, platform)` pairs
  (raising `LockfileMergeError`), and produces output byte-identical
  to a single-run `lock` over the same inputs. Mutually exclusive
  with `--environment`, `--platform`, `--skip-unsolvable`, and
  `--output`.
- `conda workspace lock` now writes a single `conda.lock` covering
  every platform declared by each environment, not just the host
  platform. Solves run with `context._subdir` overridden so conda's
  virtual package plugins (`__linux`, `__osx`, `__win`) and solver
  `subdirs` resolution target the correct subdir.
  `CONDA_OVERRIDE_*` and `[system-requirements]` continue to pin
  constraints like `__glibc`, `__cuda`, or `__osx`.
- `conda workspace lock --platform <subdir>` (repeatable) restricts
  the lock run to a subset of declared platforms. Unknown platforms
  raise `PlatformError` before any solve runs.
- `conda workspace lock --skip-unsolvable` keeps locking the
  remaining `(environment, platform)` pairs when one solve fails,
  printing a yellow `Skipping ...` line for each. Raises
  `AllTargetsUnsolvableError` if every pair fails, so CI never
  writes an empty lockfile. Non-solver errors still abort regardless.
- `--json` is now accepted across every `conda workspace` and
  `conda task` subcommand. Side-effect-only commands (`init`,
  `activate`, `run`, `shell`) used to crash with
  `unrecognized arguments: --json` when CI wrappers passed the flag
  globally; they now accept it silently and rely on the exit code.
  See the `--json contract` section in `AGENTS.md`.
- `conda workspace info --json` exposes the reachable set of
  platforms as `known_platforms` (and a `Known Platforms` row in
  text output when features broaden the workspace-level set), via
  the new `conda_workspaces.resolver.known_platforms()` helper.
- `SolveError` names the target platform when known, so
  per-platform failures stand out in CI logs.
- Inside `conda workspace shell`, `add` / `remove` / `install`
  print a hint to re-spawn the shell when a newly installed package
  drops activation scripts into `$PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/`.
- New `demos/multi-platform.{tape,gif,mp4}` recording for
  cross-platform locking and the `--platform` flag. The
  `demos/lockfile` recording was refreshed to show multi-platform
  default output.

### Changed

- `conda workspace add` and `conda workspace remove` now install into
  the affected environment(s) and refresh `conda.lock` by default,
  matching `pixi add` / `pixi remove`. Use `--no-install`,
  `--no-lockfile-update`, `--force-reinstall`, or `--dry-run` to opt
  out.
- `conda workspace install` shares a single solve/install/lock
  pipeline with `add` and `remove`
  (`conda_workspaces/cli/workspace/sync.py`).
- `conda_workspaces.parsers` renamed to `conda_workspaces.manifests`
  (named after the subject, not the verb). Class names like
  `CondaTomlParser` are unchanged; public re-exports preserved.
- `conda_workspaces.env_spec` shrunk to the `conda.toml` env-spec
  plugin (`CondaWorkspaceSpec`). `CondaLockSpec` was replaced by
  `conda_workspaces.lockfile.CondaLockLoader`.
- Plugin metadata moved to module-level `FORMAT` / `ALIASES` /
  `DEFAULT_FILENAMES` constants. The canonical lockfile `FORMAT` is
  now `conda-workspaces-lock-v1`; `conda-workspaces-lock` and
  `workspace-lock` remain as aliases. See
  `docs/reference/format-aliases.md`.
- `generate_lockfile` now builds
  `conda.models.environment.Environment` objects and delegates YAML
  serialisation to the same `multiplatform_export` hook as
  `conda export --format=conda-workspaces-lock-v1`. `conda workspace
  lock` and `conda export` now produce byte-identical output.
- `conda_workspaces.lockfile` owns both the write path and the
  `CondaEnvironmentSpecifier` plugin (`CondaLockLoader`), and
  delegates YAML→`Environment` conversion to
  `conda_lockfiles.rattler_lock.v6`. `conda.lock` is documented as a
  derivative of rattler-lock v6 (`pixi.lock`): same schema family,
  distinct filename and on-disk version byte.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-31

### Added

- `conda workspace import` command to convert `environment.yml`,
  `anaconda-project.yml`, `conda-project.yml`, `pixi.toml`, and

- Progress output during import (reading, format detection, write status)
- Syntax-highlighted TOML preview in `--dry-run` mode
- `conda task add` and `conda task remove` support for `pixi.toml` and
  `pyproject.toml` manifests

### Changed

- Import format detection uses human-readable labels instead of class names

### Changed

  as primary CLI forms (`cw` / `ct` noted as aliases)
- Aligned parsers with pixi workspace semantics for broader manifest
  compatibility
- Exception hierarchy expanded with type annotations and actionable hints

### Fixed

- JSON output in `conda task list --json` no longer includes ANSI escapes
